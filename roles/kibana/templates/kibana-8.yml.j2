# from requests it receives, and to prevent a deprecation warning at startup.
# This setting cannot end in a slash.
#server.basePath: ""

# Specifies whether Kibana should rewrite requests that are prefixed with
# `server.basePath` or require that they are rewritten by your reverse proxy.
# Defaults to `false`.

# `server.basePath` is configured this URL should end with the same basePath.

# Time in milliseconds to wait for Elasticsearch to respond to pings. Defaults to the value of

# =================== Frequently used (Optional)===================

# =================== Saved Objects: Migrations ===================
